# Investment-Analysis-Power-BI-Dashboard-CFI-BIDA-Project

## üìå Overview

This project is a Power BI dashboard developed as part of the Business Intelligence & Data Analyst (BIDA) certification program at the Corporate Finance Institute (CFI). It simulates the role of a Business Intelligence Analyst at an investment bank. The dashboard is designed to provide the sales and trading team at CFI Capital Partners with customized market analysis, offering insights into investment portfolios, securities, and exchange data.

## üéØ Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:

-   Connecting to and integrating data from multiple sources.
-   Transforming and modeling data for effective analysis.
-   Creating DAX measures to derive key performance indicators (KPIs).
-   Developing interactive and visually appealing report visuals in Power BI.
-   Providing bespoke market analysis to support the sales and trading team.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Sources

The dashboard utilizes data from the following sources:

-   **factActivity:** This table contains activity data for various securities, including `Close`, `Date`, `Price Change`, `Price Range`, `Security_ID`, and `Volume`. The data was consolidated from multiple Excel files, each representing a year of activity (2015-2021).
-   **dimSecurity:** Contains information about the securities, including `Address`, `City`, `Company`, `Country`, `Exchange_ID`, `Industry`, `Security_ID`, `State`, `Ticker Symbol`, and `Weighting`.
-   **dimExchange:** Contains details about the exchanges, such as `Currency`, `Exchange_ID`, `Exchange_Symbol`, `Location`, `Type`, and `Website`.
-   **dimDate:** A date dimension table used for time-based analysis, containing fields like `Date`, `Day`, `Month`, `Month Name`, and `Year`.

***Note: Due to confidentiality reasons, the actual datasets cannot be included in this repository. Screenshots of the data structure are provided below.***

### Data Model

The data model is structured as a star schema, with `factActivity` as the central fact table linked to the dimension tables (`dimDate`, `dimSecurity`, and `dimExchange`). The relationships are one-to-many from the dimension tables to the fact table.<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Transformation and Modeling

-   **Data Consolidation:** The `factActivity` table was created by combining multiple Excel files (2015 Activity.xlsx to 2021 Activity.xlsx), ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
-   **Relationships:** Relationships were established between the fact and dimension tables to facilitate data slicing and dicing.
-   **DAX Measures:** Custom DAX measures were created to calculate key metrics such as Average Daily Volume, Total Portfolio Value, and Price Change.
